# WNBA-tracker
Using python and OpenCV to tracking WNBA players across the court and record where game events happen(scoring, turnovers etc.)
Uses 2 windows. The game window  and the Masking window, making it easier to detect movement on the court.
Need to find a way to have boxes moving on the screen as of 12/23.
